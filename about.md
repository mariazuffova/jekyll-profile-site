I am a research associate (postdoc) at [the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies](https://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/RobertSchumanCentre) at the European University Institute (EUI). I work at the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom on [the Media pluralism monitor](https://cmpf.eui.eu/media-pluralism-monitor/mpm-2020/) project with a focus on freedom of expression, access to information, whistleblower's protection and standards of the journalistic profession.

I graduated with a PhD in Politics (2020) from [the School of Government and Public Policy](https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/governmentpublicpolicy/) - the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland. I hold an MA in public policy (2010) from [Central European University](https://spp.ceu.edu/) with a specialisation in media, information and communications policy. Besides academia, I have extensive experience working for international civil society organisations on the assessment of transparency and anti-corruption policies.

My research interests sit at the intersection of comparative politics and political communication. My PhD research focused on (1) the relationship between government transparency and accountability, (2) press-state relations and information flow and (3) public demand for government information. It combined both quantitative (standard econometric techniques, causal inference, quantitative text analysis) and qualitative methods (interviews).

Substantively, I am also interested in the social and political impact of digital technologies, in particular, with respect to gender.
