greeting: Welcome!

  T﻿hank you for your visit!


  I am a Research Associate at the [Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom](https://cmpf.eui.eu) based at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu), where I coordinate the [Media Pluralism Monitor](https://cmpf.eui.eu/media-pluralism-monitor/). I completed my PhD on the right of access to information and proactive disclosure of public-sector data, their use and impact on corruption at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/governmentpublicpolicy/). My research interests also include studying other indicators of media freedom, e.g., whistle-blowers’ protection and the safety of journalists. My work cuts across disciplines and has been published in European Political Science Review and the International Journal of Press/Politics among other journals.


  Before pursuing my PhD, I was a practitioner in the civil society sector. I helped build digital tools to improve public service delivery and facilitate interactions between political representatives, bureaucrats, and the public. As a believer in bridging academia and the policy world, I continue to engage in discussions with policymakers and public institutions. Lately, I have provided evidence to the UK Parliamentary Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on The Cabinet Office Freedom of Information Clearing House.
