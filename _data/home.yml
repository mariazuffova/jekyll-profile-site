greeting: Welcome!
teaser: >-
  I am a Research Associate at the [Centre for Media Pluralism and Media
  Freedom](https://cmpf.eui.eu) (CMPF) based at the [European University
  Institute](https://www.eui.eu), where I coordinate the [Media Pluralism
  Monitor](https://cmpf.eui.eu/media-pluralism-monitor/). Before joining CMPF, I
  completed my PhD on the right of access to information (ATI) and proactive
  disclosure of public-sector data, their use and impact on corruption at the
  University of Strathclyde. My research interests also include studying other
  indicators of media freedom, e.g., whistle-blowersâ€™ protection and the safety
  of journalists. My work cuts across disciplines and has been published in
  journals such as the European Political Science Review, the International
  Journal of Press/Politics and Government Information Quarterly. 

  Before pursuing my PhD, I was a practitioner in the civil society sector. I helped build digital tools to improve public service delivery and facilitate interactions between political representatives, bureaucrats, and the general public. In 2015, I was named one of the New Europe 100 challengers for co-creating the platform for submitting ATI requests in Slovakia. Lately, I have provided evidence to the UK Parliamentary Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on The Cabinet Office Freedom of Information Clearing House.
