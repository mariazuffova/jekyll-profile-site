greeting: Welcome!
teaser: "I am a postdoc at the [Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced
  Studies](https://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/RobertSchumanCentre) at the
  [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu). I work at the [Centre for
  Media Pluralism and Media Freedom](www.cmpf.eui.eu) on the [Media Pluralism
  Monitor project](https://cmpf.eui.eu/media-pluralism-monitor/mpm-2020/). I
  oversee the area of Fundamental Protection, where my main research interests
  are transparency reforms (freedom of information and whistleblowers'
  protection laws) and the safety of journalists.
